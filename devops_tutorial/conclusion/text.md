## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully created a Jenkins pipeline that checks that you are using secure base images when developing your own containerized applications, and depending on the security of the base images, it either builds and deploys your application or fails the build.

Recall that a lot of vulnerabilities of your applications might not come from your code itself, but from the base images you use. By using secure base images, you can reduce the attack surface of your applications and make them more resilient to attacks.
